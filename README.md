### Styling

<!-- class = "animated rollIn" style = "animation-delay: 2s; color: purple" -->
The whole text-block should appear in purple color and with a wobbling effect.
Which is a **bad** example, please use it with caution ...
~~ only this is red ;-) ~~ <!-- class = "animated infinite bounce" style = "color: red;" -->

## Charts

Use ASCII-Art to draw diagrams:

A drawing example, for demonstrating that any JavaScript library can be used, also for drawing.

```javascript
// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart1
new Chartist.Line('#chart1', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],
  series: [[100, 120, 180, 200]]
});

// Initialize a Line chart in the container with the ID chart2
new Chartist.Bar('#chart2', {
  labels: [1, 2, 3, 4],

<script>@input</script>

<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart1"></div>
<div class="ct-chart ct-golden-section" id="chart2"></div>


### Projects

You can make your code executable and define projects:

``` js     -EvalScript.js
let who = data.first_name + " " + data.last_name;

if(data.online) ip
  who + " is online"; }
else {
  who + " is NOT online"; }
```
``` json    +Data.json
{
  "first_name" :  "Sammy",
  "last_name"  :  "Shark",
  "online"     :  true
}
```
<script>
  // insert the JSON dataset into the local variable data
  let data = @input(1);

  // eval the script that uses this dataset
  eval(`@input(0)`);
</script>
